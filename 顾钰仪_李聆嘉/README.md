## Quick Start
Put all the csv data files in the same directory of the model. 

For model 1, run `lstm_train.py`, then run `lstm_test.py`. The model will be saved in `lstm.pkl` and result in `result.csv` in the same directory.

For model 2, run `lgbm_train.py`, then run `lgbm_test.py`. The model will be saved in `model.h5` and result in `result.csv` in the same directory.
